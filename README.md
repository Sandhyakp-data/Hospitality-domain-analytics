# Hospitality-domain-analytics
AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain with multiple five-star properties across India, has been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. Recently, they've faced declining market share and revenue due to competition and ineffective decision-making. To turn things around, they've opted to leverage Business and Data Intelligence, hiring a 3rd party provider to analyze their historical data and provide actionable insights to help them regain their market position.

The challenge was to create a dash board for Revenue management team which helps them to take decisions in their business.
